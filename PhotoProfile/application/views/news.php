    <p><b>01/19/2014 - Site Update</b></p>
    <p>So, after spending time developing the behind the scenese functionality of the site we determined that the front end was still not where we wanted it.</p>
	<p>I have been working quite a bit on implementing a nicer user interface and there are overall hopes of having everything up and running by the end of February.</p>
	<p>A few other updates include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating and linking a blog to the website.  The blog will contain various stories on the development of this website as well as photography.</li>
      <li>Adding a photo gallery to highlight various photographers and some of their work.  Images will contain direct links to their profiles.</li>
      <li>Portfolio page will be added to the member profile that will allow photographers to better show their talents.</li>
      <li>Various site fixes and improvements!</li>
    </ul>
	<p>We are excited for the site to be completed and for people to actually be able to utilize the features!</p>
	<br />
